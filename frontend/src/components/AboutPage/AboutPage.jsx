            <p>I built it as part of our JavaScript web development course to practice React and React Router. 
            I was also curious to try out the OpenAI API. Itâ€™s a hot topic right now, and I wanted to explore
             how it works in a real app.
                The main idea was to keep the UI minimal and focus on core functionality, 
                such as sending and receiving messages in a chat, and basic chat management 
                like renaming and deleting chats.</p>
        </div>
